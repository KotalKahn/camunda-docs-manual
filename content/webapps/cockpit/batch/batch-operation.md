# Definition Of Operation

It is possible to execute the following batch operations on process instances:

- Cancel running process instances
- Delete historic process instances
- Set retries of jobs

After selecting the operation, fields may appear with additional data that is either optional or required to perform the operation. 
When canceling running process instances, you can optionally select to skip custom listeners and provide a cancellation reason. In addition to the
ability to specify the desired operation, a search query can be specified which defines the affected process instances. Please note that 
some operations can only be executed on running process instances, while others can only be executed on finished process instances. You will see an
appropriate notice once the operation type is selected.

Navigation to the next step is disabled as long as all required data to perform the operation is not filled out.

# Confirmation Of Operation

In the next step of the process, you can review the operation that is going to be performed. One can see a short summary of affected instances
count as well as a <button class="btn btn-xs"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-eye-open"></i></button> button which toggles display of extended information. In the section with extended information, you see a path to the REST endpoint that will process the request as well as the payload of the request.

# Review Results

navigate to [batch monitoring]({{< relref "webapps/cockpit/batch/monitoring.md" >}}). In case of error, this screen will display a corresponding error message.
